RJGoogleTTS is a easy to use TTS, which capitalizes on Google's Translate Services.

It is required to set your class to have a RJGoogleTTSDelegate, so you can receive the data asynchronously!

The delegate methods are as follows: 

- (void)receivedAudio:(NSMutableData *)data;
- (void)sentAudioRequest;

- (void)receivedAudio:(NSMutableData *)data allows the developer to use a custom action when the data is received. This is required and RJGoogleTTS passes a NSMutableData object through the method

- (void)sentAudioRequest allows the developer to realize when the request has been sent. This is required and RJGoogleTTS does not pass anything through this method.

A sample project is on the way shortly!
